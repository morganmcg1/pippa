# GR00T RL Project Summary

## Project Goal
Implement RL fine-tuning (PPO and GRPO) for NVIDIA's GR00T 1.5 robotic foundation model.

## Current Status
- âœ… **Phase 1 Complete**: State-of-the-art PPO implementation with all 37 details
- ðŸš§ **Phase 2 In Progress**: Isaac Lab integration
  - âœ… Created GR00T actor-critic wrapper
  - âœ… Built training script for Isaac Lab connection
  - âœ… Test integration script ready
  - ðŸš§ Isaac Lab installation in progress on GPU machine
- ðŸ“‹ **Research Complete**: Comprehensive analysis of GRPO for robotics

## Key Findings

### 1. No Official GR00T+RL Example
- GR00T repo only supports imitation learning currently
- Isaac Lab has RL infrastructure but no GR00T integration
- We need to build the bridge ourselves (~200 lines)

### 2. GRPO Analysis for Robotics
**Pros:**
- No critic needed (saves memory for 3B param model)
- Good for verifiable tasks (pick/place, stacking)
- Can leverage Isaac's massive parallelism

**Cons:**
- Designed for single-turn LLM tasks
- Struggles with long horizons
- Normalizes away reward magnitudes
- Less effective for learning new skills

**Recommendation:** Use PPO as baseline, experiment with GRPO for specific tasks

### 3. Integration Strategy
1. Wrap GR00T in actor-critic interface
2. Start with frozen backbone
3. Use conservative hyperparameters
4. Test on simple tasks first

## Implementation Plan

### This Week
- [x] Code deployed to GPU machine (192.222.53.15)
- [x] Isaac Lab and rsl_rl cloned
- [ ] Install Isaac Lab environment (in progress)
- [x] Create GR00T wrapper (completed)
- [ ] Run first integration test

### Next Week
- [ ] Implement GRPO variant
- [ ] Benchmark PPO vs GRPO
- [ ] Select best approach

### This Month
- [ ] Progressive unfreezing experiments
- [ ] Multi-task curriculum
- [ ] Performance optimization
