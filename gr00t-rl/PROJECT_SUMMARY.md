# GR00T RL Project Summary

## Project Goal
Implement RL fine-tuning (PPO and GRPO) for NVIDIA's GR00T N1.5 robotic foundation model with Gymnasium-Robotics environments.

## Current Status
- âœ… **Phase 1 Complete**: State-of-the-art PPO implementation with all 37 details
- âœ… **Phase 2 Complete**: Environment integration with Gymnasium-Robotics
  - âœ… PPO working with Fetch environments
  - âœ… WandB video logging implemented
  - âœ… Debug mode for rapid testing
- ðŸš§ **Phase 3 In Progress**: GR00T model integration
  - ðŸš§ Creating GR00T policy wrapper
  - ðŸš§ Implementing observation preprocessing
  - ðŸ“‹ Following SO-101 adaptation pattern
- ðŸ“‹ **Research Complete**: Comprehensive analysis of GRPO for robotics

## Key Findings

### 1. GR00T Model Architecture
- 3B parameter vision-language-action model
- Uses diffusion transformer for action generation
- Supports new embodiments via EmbodimentTag.NEW_EMBODIMENT
- SO-101 blog shows successful adaptation pattern

### 2. GRPO Analysis for Robotics
**Pros:**
- No critic needed (saves memory for 3B param model)
- Good for verifiable tasks (pick/place, stacking)
- Can leverage Isaac's massive parallelism

**Cons:**
- Designed for single-turn LLM tasks
- Struggles with long horizons
- Normalizes away reward magnitudes
- Less effective for learning new skills

**Recommendation:** Use PPO as baseline, experiment with GRPO for specific tasks

### 3. Integration Strategy
1. Create GR00T policy wrapper with new embodiment head
2. Preprocess Gymnasium observations (resize images, extract proprio)
3. Optional: SFT bootstrapping from demonstrations
4. PPO fine-tuning with frozen vision/language encoders
5. Progressive unfreezing with LoRA for efficiency
