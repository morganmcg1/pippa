# GR00T RL Integration Roadmap

## Current Status (2025-06-15)

### âœ… Phase 1: Core PPO Implementation (COMPLETED)
- Implemented PPO with all 37 details from ICLR blog
- Created modular architecture (algorithms, utils, environments)
- Comprehensive logging with WandB
- Verified implementation correctness

### âœ… Phase 2: Environment Integration (COMPLETED)
- Switched from Isaac Gym/Lab to Gymnasium-Robotics
- Successfully integrated with Fetch environments
- PPO training working with dense/sparse rewards
- Video logging to WandB tables implemented
- Tested on GPU machine (192.222.53.15)

### ðŸš§ Phase 3: GR00T Model Integration (IN PROGRESS)
- GR00T N1.5 is a 3B parameter vision-language-action model
- Uses diffusion transformer for action generation
- Supports new embodiments via EmbodimentTag.NEW_EMBODIMENT
- Following SO-101 adaptation pattern from HuggingFace blog

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 4: Progressive Training Strategy
- Optional SFT bootstrapping from demonstrations
- PPO fine-tuning with frozen backbone
- Progressive unfreezing with LoRA adaptation
- Memory-efficient training strategies

## Key Research Findings

### GRPO for Robotics: Pros and Cons

**Pros:**
- No critic network needed (saves memory for 3B param model)
- Works well for verifiable tasks (success/fail outcomes)
- Leverages relative performance comparisons
- Can use Isaac Lab's massive parallelism

**Cons:**
- Designed for single-turn LLM tasks, not multi-step episodes
- Normalizes away reward magnitudes (problematic for sparse rewards)
- Requires multiple rollouts from same initial state
- Less effective for teaching completely new skills

**Recommendation:** Start with standard PPO as baseline, then experiment with GRPO for specific tasks with clear success metrics.

### GR00T Integration Steps

1. **Install GR00T Model:**
   ```bash
   # Install Isaac-GR00T for model access
   git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/Isaac-GR00T
   cd Isaac-GR00T
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. **Create GR00T RL Policy Wrapper:**
   ```python
   class GR00TRLPolicy(nn.Module):
       def __init__(self, 
                    model_name_or_path="nvidia/GR00T-N1.5-3B",
                    action_dim=4,  # Fetch uses 4D actions
                    proprio_dim=13,  # Fetch observation space
                    embodiment_tag="new_embodiment"):
           # Load GR00T with new embodiment head
           self.gr00t = load_gr00t_model(...)
           # Add value head for PPO
           self.value_head = nn.Sequential(...)
   ```

3. **Adapt for Gymnasium-Robotics:**
   - Preprocess observations (resize images to 224x224)
   - Extract proprioception from gym observations
   - Add language instructions
   - Handle 4D action space (dx, dy, dz, gripper)

4. **Available Environments:**
   - `FetchReach-v3` (simple reaching)
   - `FetchPush-v3` (pushing objects)
   - `FetchPickAndPlace-v3` (pick and place)
   - `FetchSlide-v3` (sliding objects)

## Implementation Strategy

### Short Term (This Week)
1. âœ… Test PPO on Gymnasium-Robotics Fetch environments
2. ðŸš§ Create GR00T policy wrapper with embodiment adaptation
3. ðŸš§ Implement observation preprocessing pipeline

### Medium Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Integrate GR00T model with frozen weights
2. Optional: Collect demonstrations for SFT bootstrapping
3. Benchmark GR00T+PPO performance vs baseline

### Long Term (Month+)
1. Progressive unfreezing experiments with LoRA
2. Multi-task training across Fetch environments
3. Optimize for inference speed and memory usage

## Technical Considerations

### Memory Management
- GR00T is 3B parameters
- Critic adds ~10M parameters
- Use gradient accumulation if needed
- Consider LoRA for efficient fine-tuning

### Training Speed
- Gymnasium-Robotics runs at ~1kHz with rendering
- GR00T inference: ~50Hz (20ms per action)
- Use vectorized environments (4-16 for memory constraints)

### Logging
- Track prompt/instruction used
- Log episodic returns
- Monitor KL divergence from base model
- Save checkpoints frequently

## GRPO Implementation Notes

When implementing GRPO:
1. Generate N rollouts per initial state
2. Compute mean reward across rollouts
3. Advantage = reward - mean(rewards)
4. No value network needed
5. Monitor for normalization issues
