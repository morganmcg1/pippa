# GR00T RL Integration Roadmap

## Current Status (2025-01-15)

### âœ… Phase 1: Core PPO Implementation (COMPLETED)
- Implemented PPO with all 37 details from ICLR blog
- Created modular architecture (algorithms, utils, environments)
- Comprehensive logging with WandB
- Verified implementation correctness

### ðŸš§ Phase 2: Isaac Lab Integration (NEXT)
Based on research findings:
- No official GR00T+PPO example exists yet
- Isaac Lab has PPO infrastructure via rsl_rl, rl_games, skrl
- Need ~200 lines of glue code to connect GR00T to RL runners

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 3: GR00T Model Integration
- GR00T uses DiT-based action head (not Gaussian)
- Need to wrap GR00T policy with critic for actor-critic API
- Start with frozen backbone, progressively unfreeze

### ðŸ”¬ Phase 4: GRPO Experimentation
- GRPO could work for robotics but has trade-offs
- Best for verifiable tasks with clear success metrics
- Leverage Isaac Lab's parallelism for group sampling

## Key Research Findings

### GRPO for Robotics: Pros and Cons

**Pros:**
- No critic network needed (saves memory for 3B param model)
- Works well for verifiable tasks (success/fail outcomes)
- Leverages relative performance comparisons
- Can use Isaac Lab's massive parallelism

**Cons:**
- Designed for single-turn LLM tasks, not multi-step episodes
- Normalizes away reward magnitudes (problematic for sparse rewards)
- Requires multiple rollouts from same initial state
- Less effective for teaching completely new skills

**Recommendation:** Start with standard PPO as baseline, then experiment with GRPO for specific tasks with clear success metrics.

### GR00T Integration Steps

1. **Setup Repos:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/Isaac-GR00T
   git clone https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab
   git clone https://github.com/leggedrobotics/rsl_rl
   ```

2. **Create Actor-Critic Wrapper:**
   ```python
   class Gr00tActorCritic(nn.Module):
       def __init__(self, gr00t_policy, obs_dim):
           self.gr00t = gr00t_policy
           self.critic = nn.Sequential(
               nn.Linear(obs_dim, 512), nn.Tanh(),
               nn.Linear(512, 1))
       def act(self, obs):
           return self.gr00t(obs)
       def value(self, obs):
           return self.critic(obs)
   ```

3. **Use Conservative PPO Settings:**
   - Smaller clip range (0.1)
   - Fewer epochs (2-3)
   - KL penalty (beta=0.01)
   - Freeze backbone initially

4. **Available Environments:**
   - `Isaac-Humanoid-Direct-v0` (full humanoid)
   - `Isaac-Stack-Cube-Franka-v0` (manipulation)
   - `Isaac-Open-Drawer-Franka-v0` (interaction)

## Implementation Strategy

### Short Term (This Week)
1. Test our PPO on standard Isaac Lab envs
2. Study rsl_rl integration patterns
3. Create minimal GR00T wrapper

### Medium Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Integrate GR00T backbone with frozen weights
2. Benchmark PPO performance
3. Implement GRPO variant for comparison

### Long Term (Month+)
1. Progressive unfreezing experiments
2. Multi-task curriculum learning
3. Sim-to-real transfer preparation

## Technical Considerations

### Memory Management
- GR00T is 3B parameters
- Critic adds ~10M parameters
- Use gradient accumulation if needed
- Consider LoRA for efficient fine-tuning

### Training Speed
- Isaac Lab can run 10kHz+ simulation
- Target: 10k steps/sec minimum
- Use vectorized environments (2048+)

### Logging
- Track prompt/instruction used
- Log episodic returns
- Monitor KL divergence from base model
- Save checkpoints frequently

## GRPO Implementation Notes

When implementing GRPO:
1. Generate N rollouts per initial state
2. Compute mean reward across rollouts
3. Advantage = reward - mean(rewards)
4. No value network needed
5. Monitor for normalization issues
